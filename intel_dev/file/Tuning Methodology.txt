When optimizing your code for parallel hardware, consider using the following iterative approach:

Ignore the top two elements if you are not running on a cluster. There is not a recommended start point what to optimize first as this may vary. Pop up a level, look at all the potential optimizations and see where you can get the biggest gain for the least work. That is where you want to start.
Intel provides the following performance analysis tools that can help you to go through this performance optimization workflow:
