For better understanding of the performance data provided by the Intel® VTune™ Amplifier, you are highly recommended to explore additional resources on the web.

Intel® Processor Information
For the most updates, errata, and the latest information on Intel processors, explore the resources available at http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html. The following sections describe processor manuals for Intel 64, IA-32 architecture processors and for Intel Itanium® processors.
Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Manuals
The Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual consists of the following volumes that describe the architecture and programming environment of all Intel 64 and IA-32 architecture processors:


Volume 1 describes the architecture and programming environment of processors supporting IA-32 and Intel 64 architectures.


Volume 2 includes the full Instruction Set Reference, A-Z, in one volume. Describes the format of the instruction and provides reference pages for instructions.


Volume 3 includes the full System Programming Guide, Parts 1, 2, and 3, in one volume. Describes the operating-system support environment of Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures, including: memory management, protection, task management, interrupt and exception handling, multi-processor support, thermal and power management features, debugging, performance monitoring, system management mode, VMX instructions, and Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT).


Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Documentation Changes section describes bug fixes made to the Intel 64 and IA-32 Software Developer's Manual between versions.

Note
This Change Document applies to all Intel 64 and IA-32 Software Developer's Manual sets (combined volume set, 3 volume set and 7 volume set).



Please refer to all volumes when evaluating your design needs.
